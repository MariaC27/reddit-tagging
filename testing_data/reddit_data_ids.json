And now I\u2019m nauseas and my stomach is hurting (higher up now, the cramping was lower). Also, heartburn because why not? I have a 7 inch incline bed wedge under my mattress too. It was a miracle for my heartburn while still on the kratom. Now though, it does absolutely nothing as well as the two PPI\u2019s I\u2019m on (it is literally insane.)\n\nSo the other day I took the pepto it helped and I got the black stool that is common from that med and actually lets me know it did something. Yesterday I took it and my body was like, naaaah you didn\u2019t lol.\n\nImodium helps slow things down, but I\u2019m having symptoms that I think the pepto would help more right now. But if it doesn\u2019t do anything like sometimes it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll take the Imodium. \n\nNothing ever helped me like kratom did. Took it for years and years from a reputable online vendor. IBS was manageable to the point I could eat out again and do things away from my home and bathroom. I had a quality of life again! However, I got very sick recently (in the ER sick) so my body forced me to stop, I couldn\u2019t keep anything in my body, so dehydrated my kidneys were not functioning well. Sinus tachycardia on the EKG. No blood clots though from the D-Dimer blood test. Just did a 24 hr urine test and it was high with protein. So I\u2019m super scared to start taking the kratom again, just because my health isn\u2019t good right now. I\u2019ll be having a kidney ultrasound next week.\n\nAnd let me be really honest here. I\u2019ve taken the kratom for 8 years now, on and off but mostly on. I was sick and on disability by 25.. finished up my college degree and couldn\u2019t even use it.. so life was bad, mentally and physically. The kratom normalized my bowels for the first time since I got on disability. It was life changing. It even helped my mental health but mostly I think that was because I wasn\u2019t shitting myself and feeling like a helpless, useless waste of oxygen. \n\nI\u2019ve been on omeperozol since I was 17 years old. I\u2019m 33 now. If anything has caused damage to my body, it is that, the countless meds I tried and were on, and still on before kratom. Medical field had also severely neglected me so I had to try something myself or I wasn\u2019t gonna make it, ya know?\n\nSo.. there are options, but just like treating a broken tooth with Tylenol, too much for too long is going to hurt you. Hell, I\u2019ve taken more Imodium in my life than almost anything else by now and had two doctors tell me not to take it long term. Too late lol.\n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t wanna die from an organ failure or a disease, but I already have a disease that no one can/will treat. I see my final GI (I\u2019ve seen dozens all over my state) on the 15th. I plan to stay off the kratom so he can do his tests and workup, make sure I won\u2019t have that in the way of colonoscopy preps and stuff. But if I get no treatment or relief, you can mark my words right now, I\u2019m going back to what kept me alive this far, because the doctors and their poisons sure haven\u2019t helped me.\n\nSorry I got a little carried away there. I don\u2019t condone just taking anything though. Try what you have, try something new if you want, just always be careful and listen to your body and what it tells you the best you can. Oh, off for my 3rd trip now! Pray for me lol.\n\nTL;DR: Pepto is my go to when I\u2019m dealing with heartburn and tummy cramps/pain because Imodium just doesn\u2019t help with that. At this point though, I might end up having to take both today. Other stuff is available but proceed with caution and it is not for everyone.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve taken both recently. Contemplating right now what to take. I just woke up with horrific cramping followed by lava shits, twice. And now I\u2019m nauseas and my stomach is hurting (higher up now, the cramping was lower). Also, heartburn because why not? I have a 7 inch incline bed wedge under my mattress too. It was a miracle for my heartburn while still on the kratom. Now though, it does absolutely nothing as well as the two PPI\u2019s I\u2019m on (it is literally insane.)\n\nSo the other day I took the pepto it helped and I got the black stool that is common from that med and actually lets me know it did something. Yesterday I took it and my body was like, naaaah you didn\u2019t lol.\n\nImodium helps slow things down, but I\u2019m having symptoms that I think the pepto would help more right now. But if it doesn\u2019t do anything like sometimes it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll take the Imodium. \n\nNothing ever helped me like kratom did. Took it for years and years from a reputable online vendor.

It started with me eating a salad from Vons and feeling not right, I had a sporting event so I took pepto to try and fix it. The next day, felt poorly too and had school so again took some. It became a series of every morning have stomach problems and having to take pepto in order to be able to make it thru and school day. In these school days I couldn\u2019t eat. Practically since the day I ate that salad, after I ate had to shit almost immediately afterwards and it wasn\u2019t nessicarly and normal bowel movement either. \n\nI grew concerned at the amount of pepto I was taking so as soon as I graduated (highschool) I stopped taking it pretty much cold turkey. This provided me a day or twos relief but since then it\u2019s been constant IBS Symptoms. I\u2019ve seen a Dr 2x about this now and at first she put me on a low FODMAP (I\u2019m sure many of you are familiar :/) which after 3 weeks (of being so strict and I thought so good) had no improvement, so as I tried to reintroduce my diriahha and bathroom  problem increases dramatically not matter what i reintroduced. I went from having a few good days ina row to a few bad ina row before Low FODMAP to having consistent bad ones with bloating and bad gas constantly. \n\nI returned to the dr explained it was not helping and I had done research and believed I had SIBO, she then sent me for blood work and a stool sample. The blood work came up with nothing wrong and I\u2019m waiting on the stool sample results still. \n\nHas anyone else been as stupid as me and taken pepto the point where it\u2019s ruined their life? I\u2019m a wrestler and was concerned that the cutting weight and diet changes could have influenced this but after research I shouldn\u2019t still be feeling these side effects. I\u2019m positive it\u2019s connected to the pepto abuse. (Something I never thought I\u2019d admit). Has anyone else struggled with this and what did you do/ how are you now? \n\nPlease help a girl out. XOXO",

Just search this forum and you\u2019ll see lots of Imodium posts and comments. \n\nIt sounds like you have post-infectious IBS, which is what I ended up with after getting sick from Wendy\u2019s in June of 2023. I\u2019m much better, but still not 100%. I still have to take Imodium and watch my diet closely. It caused me to have multiple food sensitivities and intolerances including a dairy allergy (confirmed by blood tests). \n\nI read that you can still shed viral cells for many months. I tested positive for Norovirus about six months after that episode from Wendy\u2019s. The weird thing is I never knew I had a virus. I never had fever or vomiting. I just had chronic diarrhea, and thought it was a mysterious uptick in my usual IBS.",

Artificial sweeteners are not my friends. I never met one that didn't upset my gut.\n\nSo are there any products with the same active ingredients but without artificial sweeteners? Or is it to be assumed that it is a small enough quantity that any detrimental effects will be outweighed by the relief they provide?\n\nHonestly I find it kind of exasperating that so many products aimed at treating GI issues contain ingredients know for aggravating GI issues. I'd love to hear from anyone who could shed some light on this, or anyone who has already done some searching on this themselves.",

But has anybody else developed a sort of sensitivity to Pepto bismol on your various toilet journeys?\n\nI've always had a nervous gut, so I've been taking Pepto Bismol semi-regularly my whole life. But especially now since developing IBS issues over the past year. \n\nNormally it's completely fine, at worst it might constipate me for a couple days after taking it. (Which honestly after a bad bout of diarrhea, it's not an unwelcome change, lol.) But recently things have changed.\n\nI've noticed I will have like IBS aftershocks the day after I take Pepto. Where it's not a full-on IBS-D episode and it's not my gut reacting to any sort of trigger food. But it's like I have a mini version of an IBS episode where my body seems to be flushing out all the Pepto from my system.\n\nThis made sense when it happened after taking quite a bit of Pepto in one sitting. But now I've noticed it happening after taking only one dose (15ml.)\n\nI dunno, has anybody else experienced anything like this? Is there some other anti-diarrheal I should be taking instead? Or have I just relied on the pink stuff too long and need to lay off it for a while? \ud83d\ude05",

So this upset my stomach a lot. I had a big meeting that day I couldn't miss, so I took 2 pepto's. Well, last night I started cramping and having diarrhea since the pepto wore off. \n\nI'm nervous since before, pepto would just stop the symptoms permanently. Do you guys re-get symptoms after it's worn off? Or do you think it's a stomach bug or something else?  A year ago they thought I have pancreatic insufficiency, but then after some supplementations, my numbers went back up to normal. This is the first time I have had diarrhea since October, so there is just some paranoia of \"what if I'm about to start getting constantly sick again\", and I just want to live a normal life without worrying about getting sick. \n\nI'm pretty sure my initial symptoms were connected to the coffee, but I'm not sure why the pepto didn't stop it permanently, since i was just a trigger food I haven't had since.

        "content": "Hey Everyone!\n\nMe: 30F, diagnosed in 2017 and 2023 twice with Microscopic Colitis - mixed lymph and coll; Chronic Diarrhea (#7 on stool chart). Below are my results from several tests:\n\n(2024) blood work: normal - except for high cholesterol, triglycerides, and low vitamin d. tTG-IgA blood test is normal = not sensitive to gluten (confirmed 2023 and 2024).\n\nStool Culture test: Pancreatic enzyme between 200's and 300's and Calproctin was normal in 2023 but elevated in 2024. Negative for H.Pylori and Salmonella\n\n(2024) SIBO test - No spike in my small intestine but did increase when reached in colon. I may re-take the SIBO test. Furthermore, months before the SIBO test, I did do the low-fodmap diet and I still had chronic diarrhea but less urgency.\n\nTreatment: I have taken budesonide but I still had water diarrhea but less urgency. I do think my Microscopic is anxiety inducing and may wonder to TCA anti-depressants, as well for treatment. I am constantly worrying about a bathroom.\n\n\\*\\*After my 3rd colonoscopy this week, this is the treatment I was thinking:\\*\\*\n\n8-week course of Pepto Bismol tablets \u2013 8 tab/per day for 8 weeks (3 morning before food; 2 afternoon before food; 3 afternoon before food) - I will take this while on the Autoimmune Protocol diet (also gluten free) during those 8 weeks.\n\nFurthermore while taking Pepto, I read that Pepto can kill off all the bacteria in your gut. So, I wanted to take VSL#3 (2 pills morning and 2 pills in evening) while on pepto.\n\n Has anyone done a similar treatment or have similar test results? If so, what was your experience. Thanks!",

I started seeing a GI for my symptoms and he put me on a regimen of pepto bismol, IB guard, and probiotics (plus avoiding my triggers), which has helped a lot. It\u2019s been a little over a month and I\u2019m trying to scale down my pepto bismol dose, but when I\u2019ve tried going a day without taking it I get cramping and diarrhea again. My GI says that taking pepto bismol long term isn\u2019t an issue, but I\u2019m curious if anyone else\u2019s has said the same? I\u2019ve read online that it isn\u2019t supposed to be used long term and I ideally wouldn\u2019t want to be taking this for much longer. Appreciate the help :)",

I never got a diagnosis so I don\u2019t know what kind, but normally I have upset stomach once or twice a week or so, and I carry pepto bismol around in case I need it. In the past month or so I started getting upset stomach almost every day and so I began taking pepto pretty much every day.\n\nThis would be fine except my left ear now suddenly goes deaf on occasion and my tinnitus which is normally not noticeable over ambient volume has become distracting. I found out that pepto can cause these exact symptoms and while I was relieved that I\u2019m not going deaf, I now need to find an OTC pepto alternative that would be safe to take pretty much every day. \n\nWhat do you guys use and how often, and if you have any side effects I\u2019d appreciate if you could note that as well, thank you.\n\nEdit: I guess I should clarify that my upset stomach involves waves of painful cramps and diarrhea",

I wish didn\u2019t happen but when I have C its all a strain \ud83e\udd72) you can cause a brain bleed or dangerously increased ICP\u2026 for me chronic constipation around the times of my brain surgeries lead me to severe constipation for weeks to a month which was really dangerous.

For me, diarrhea sucks in the moments leading up to it and I\u2019ve had a few close calls in public which was scary, but constipation is always so much more painful for the days/weeks/ until BMs, so I personally hate C more.
